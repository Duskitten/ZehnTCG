# ZehnTCG
A trading card game about meeting unique people.

## Basic Gameplay:
- Make a deck of 10 cards
- Find another person with a deck
- Both pick a number between 1 and 10
- The reverse player who said the number, draws that card from its position in the deck (from the top)
- If both share an attribute, then you both lose
- If both are unique, you both win

## Basic Card Rules
- Cards must have one of each of the following modifiers (starting at the top):
  - ### Slot 1: Color
    - The following colors are valid:
      - Red
      - Blue
      - Yellow
      - Orange
      - Purple
      - Green
      - Black
      - White
    - !!! Make sure to color the boarder this for easier legibility !!!
  
  - ### Slot 2: Base Type
    - Make sure to be vague with this, as overly defining this may lead to gamebreaking bugs lol, for example:
      - instead of "T-Rex", maybe put "Dinosaur"
      - instead of "T34-85", maybe put "Tank"

  - ### Slot 3: Visualization Method
    - Make sure to be semi-precise with this, for example:
      - If you print, draw with crayons, and scan it, make sure to put "Crayon" in this slot
      - If you use a rendered 3D model, try "3D Modeled"
      - If you use a pencil, maybe "Sketched"
     
- Otherwise, have fun with making up new ideas!

## Card Submissions:
  - If you would like to submit a card to the database here, please download the template, and edit it, or print and re-scan it to the correct dimensions as the template
  - After that, make a git issue with a link to your card face through imgur or something
  - I'll try my best to add it assuming it meets the criteria above
